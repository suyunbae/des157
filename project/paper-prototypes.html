            <p id="text">From the storyboard, I've gained various inputs on how a user likes to navigate through the website. One suggestion for improving
            the website is possibly getting rid of title page as it takes too much real estate and there is already an assumption that the user is on the page
            knowing that they want to check their language usage. Another criticism was to improve the layout of the page by combining the three text fields into
          one as it can reduce clutter and make it more dynamic and interactive.</p>
