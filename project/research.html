            <p id="text">We always hear that diversity is wanted and needed to improve whatever discipline and society. And because we now live in age where problems are both hyper local and global, "the role of diversity-whether that means race, gender, sexuality, age, or simply, point of view-has never been more important" (Bolt). In her op-ed, Bolt shows examples that design, as an industry, has long improved from affirmative action. Most large corporations seek out diversity as a natural integration of their business plan (Bolt).<br><br>

              But even so, the structure of design has a discipline has not much changed since of the founders: the white old men (AIGA). Diversity and innovation are said to be related, so when diversity is truly introduced a whole new field of creativity and innovation can occur. However, this is a problem where the workforce in general has not caught up. The talk of diversity has embedded into our lives, but the interaction and lifestyle has not.
              <br><br>
              A clear example is shown in the field of engineering and science. There has been several research and talks showing that diversity is a positive benefit in STEM, yet there has not been much change. For example, only 19 percent of students enrolled in AP computer science classes in 2012 were female, and only 12 percent were students of color (Novak). Then we might begin to wonder what are the possible reasons why students may not enter the field of computer science or STEM in general. A reason is that only 1 in 10 US high schools teaches computer science, and while students from the middle to higher-end of the socioeconomics have access to these social networks and resources, lower-end students do not (Novak). But perhaps another reason why there is not much diversity in STEM and computer science in general is the lack of exposure of representations.

              In a TedxYouth talk, Lilibeth Perez stood in the front of a gymnasium prompting, "Imagine a computer programmer." She responds to her own rhetoric by stating, "Youâ€¦ probably thought of a male, Caucasian, in his thirties, poor social skills, maybe poorly dressed." And that's a general stereotype and depiction of who is a computer scientist. So that's why Amy Wibowo decided to create her own company called BubbleSorts Zines. BubbleSort Zines are a monthly zine series filled with stories and hand-drawn art and diagrams. They cover topics like circuits, sorting, memory, and tcp (BubbleSorts Zines).</p>

              <p id="text">Its intentions are to welcome any student who is interested in computer science and femininity. Computer science is generally geared towards male-demographics and with a dark, sombrous color palette. But Amy tries to challenge that by exposing the same computer science tools, but in pastel and pink. She believes that lack of diversity isn't due to a lack of effort of getting girls into computer science, but rather a pipeline problem. She contends that underrepresented demographics are told that math and science are not meant for them and participation decreases as they are in high school. So instead, it is our responsibility and obligation to make any child feel welcomed, included, and supported.</p><br><br><br>
