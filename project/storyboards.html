            <p id="text">The Polish Alphabet is still an interactive website, but it relies more heavily on clicking and visual effects. Though the difference is slight, I believe it makes a difference when presenting the material to the audience. For example, because The Polish Alphabet is designed to teach users who are not Polish the Polish language, it relies heavily on visual cues and words that are familiar. On the other hand, Message from Earth is conveying the status of Earth and uses all sorts of techniques to engage the user. <br><br>

            With the information layout, The Polish Alphabet relies more on clicking. Though I believe it is fine to click for a few slides, the Polish Alphabet has 39 characters. So I believe it is beyond the usual comfort for a user having to click through so much. In addition, I believe the visual density from The Polish Alphabet is too distracting. Each time the user is flipping through the content, it shows a transition slide. In the beginning, this transition slide is a nice, visual appeal, but after flipping through numerous letters it becomes cumbersome and tiring. In addition, due to the animation of the letters, the user can become easily distracted in terms of what to focus on. There are many text boxes, visual highlights, and animations. This can become overwhelming as the user may not know where to focus and miss the core information.<br><br>

            However, The Polish Alphabet does an overall good job on conveying the information of the Polish language. I think it was quirky and neat in demonstrating a language to a foreigner. This project highlights the aspect of diversity as it touches upon language diversity. English and Chinese are one of the most popular languages in the world, but it is interesting to bring highlight to ones that are not most predominant in society, such as Polish. </p>
