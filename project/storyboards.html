            <p id="text">The purpose of this storyboard is to guide the user the goal of this project. Whether two individuals are having
            a conflict or an individual has received a comment/review which he or she feels is biased in anyway, this project is meant to help the individual
            share and encourage discussion about the language they feel wronged about. Language is an ever-evoling phenomena and it is up
            to individuals to learn and educate themselves so we do not hurt people with our words. So once an individual has feel there is toxicity in the
            language, they can paste the original message into a textbox and then see the analysis of what is particularly wrong or harmful with the language.
            Ideally afterwards the two individuals would meet again and discuss the usage of language and what they can do to prevent this from
            happening again.</p>

            <p id="text">After receiving feedback, it seems like people were still intitially confused as to what the end result would look like.
            So in the second round of storyboarding, I have focused on showing more concrete examples of what I envision in the end. In this case,
            I have used an example of "Don't be such a b*tch". Once the user has pasted this statement, it will highlight and show little pop-up
            messages that respectfully explain why the term "b*tch" is harmful. The motivation for people to use this product is to validate their
            feelings and experiences. When someone uses a harmful language to you, it can be hard to discern whether that is just a voice in your head
            or a validated response. Historically minorities have received backlash with harmful words so it is validate their feelings and encourage a
            health discussion in order to make sure a similar situation does not occur again.</p>
