            <p id="text">We always hear that diversity is wanted and needed to improve whatever discipline and society. And because we now live in age where problems are both hyper local and global, "the role of diversity-whether that means race, gender, sexuality, age, or simply, point of view-has never been more important" (Bolt). In addition, diversity is now crucial in order to make sure all individuals feel welcome, supported, and empowered in their environment.<br><br>

            <strong>Design theory, methods, and critical perspectives:</strong><br><br>
            The web application in supporting diverse and more critical languages does support diversity as aims to teach and empower individuals who feel marginalized. For example, in the current political and social stage, where pronouns are starting to appear more personal and central, it is important to educate those who might not be certain how to address others. And knowledge, in general, is the best form of support in order to prevent bigotry and prejudice.<br><br>

            In addition, due to pop culture and other forms of media, certain phrases or words still carry a strong influence today. For example, the word "bitch" is still commonly used today when describing a female or insulting an individual, but it carries strong connotations on marginalized folks. Thus those who are privileged and have access to many resources should support the marginalized and reduce negative connotation on words, such as the one previously stated.<br><br>

            Therefore, this web application will aim to analyze the contextual meaning behind the words in order to support diversity as language is an ever-growing phenomena. A limitation to this webtool is the algorithm itself. If the algorithm is strongly accurate, then result will show and vice versa.<br><br>

            <strong>Experience:</strong><br><br>
            The experience of addressing diversity is only adequate for the English language, and more specifically to American language. As stated, language is diverse and strongly correlated to the context of where these words/phrases originate from. In addition, the usability for those who are colorblind or fully blind is still being thought of as this current form is meant for those who have full or partial abilities to their eyes.<br><br>

            For example, in the web tool, it was thought that colors would help distinguish and educate the user, but in the case that user is color blind then there would need to be alternative way to address this issue.<br><br>

            <strong>Application:</strong><br><br>
            The tool is defined for those who want to educate themselves on their language usage or whether an individual wants to share their sentiments about the language usage that another person has used on them.<br><br>

            <strong>Technological Innovation:</strong><br><br>
            This webtool kit is meant for anyone who has access to the internet. In the future stage, it would be idea where a user would be able to use this tool regardless of whether there is internet or not and see how their language usage has changed over time.</p>
