            <p id="text">At first, Samantha was having a hard time connecting what the prompt was asking her to do compared
            to the actual project. For example, in the actual textbox she wrote random sentences, instead of typing the given
          sentences to try out. But once she knew what to do and typed the sample sentences, she thought it was a very novel and
          cool idea to learn more about the words in an interactive way. She suggested by adding a new tab of problematic words so it would be
          be easier and faster to learn about the words in general.<br>
          From Samantha's comments I edited the prompt so it would be more succint and more helpful to guide the users with the system. I am
        still debating about adding a glossary of problematic words since it would somewhat defeat the purpose of this app, but overall it seems like
        I am on the right track.</p>

            <p id="text">Similar with Samantha, Adriana was initially having a hard time connecting what the prompt was asking and executing the task. I thought
            it was interesting that even when Adriana did type the problematic words she did not hover over the highlight-problamtic word. She explained the
            animation detered her from doing so because she thought the text on the side would explain everything. She also suggested changing the color-scheme
          as she thought it was not the most appropriate or best color choice. I agree her sentiment as I think a more clean look would be more fitting for the purpose
          of this app. Lastly, she suggested about having a little icon next to the highlighted-problematic word as it would indicate to the user that the icon is something
        that the user should check out. But overall, Adriana also expressed the same sentiments that it is a cool idea and she can't wait to see the final results!</p>
